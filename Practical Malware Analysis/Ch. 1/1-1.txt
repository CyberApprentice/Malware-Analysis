    DLL:
        $ IP address from strings, "127.26.152.13"

6) What does the malware do?
    $ Creates a process and places a file on the system and threatens or has potential to damage the system. Connects back remotely to the IP address "127.26.152.13" that serves as the command and control server or backdoor.

Answer:
$ .dll and .exe were compiled within one minute of each other so we can assume they come from the same package, author, and will be used together.
    The .exe imports suggest that the file searches and modifies files. The .exe strings points out a character mixup of '1' for 'l' in the string,
    "C:\windows\system32\kerne132.dll" which serves as a host-based indicator. The .dll shows networking functions and two imports, "CreateProcess" 
    and "Sleep" that are commonly used for backdoors along with "exec" to create processes and "sleep" the backdoor when not in use.
