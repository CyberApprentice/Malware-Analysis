Questions to be answered:
1) Are these known AV definitions?
2) Is it packed?
3) What are the imports/exports and what can you infer from the functionality?
4) file size?
5) Host-based or network-based indicators?
6) Are there any binaries in the resource section? This could mean embedded malware, extract and reanalyze if so.

1. Upload to virustotal.com to find exisiting AV definitions
2. Run through PEiD & PEview
    - PEiD is can be incorrect so we use PEview to double check but I personally prefer PEiD.
    - PEiD provides a tool form of quickly checking if it's packed while PEview is for the analyst to decide.
3. Load into Pestudio
    - looking for date/time (modification)
    - it also provides hashes that can be used for hash analysis
    - Also provides indicators, strings, imports, virustotal, and more. My favorite easy-to-use tool.
    - Con: doesn't know the time zone
        $ Use PEview > IMAGE_NT_HEADERS > IMAGE_FILE_HEADERS > date/time stamp
4. Resource Hacker or PEview
    - view the .rsrc section in PEview, if you see a binary you'll have to use resource hacker to extract this.
    - To tell if it's a binary, check if "BIN" or "This program cannot be run in DOS mode" which is a indicator that it is a PE (.exe)
